Creating mandala using the p5.js Web editor

To be honest, I don't know much about coding or p5.js, so I went with the most basic design that my limited knowledge of coding and the p5.js programming language could produce. I don't have any pattern in mind when making this output. I just wanted my output to look neat and clean. Also a simple one.

If there was face to face classes, I would want to learn more about game development and more about programming.
